# Connify
My nephew made up an algorithm that boils down to 4x.  
I made this for his 8th birthday in hopes he'll discover the joys of code, and the goal is to have him rewrite this over time.

* Sinatra is cool.  I feel a little guilty about since I wrote this while mentoring at a Rails Bridge event.
* Skeleton css is pretty cool, though I wish it handled meta for mobile out of box since it's mobile-first and whatnot.
* Slim for always.
